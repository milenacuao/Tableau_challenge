Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

For both males and females, the average trip duration seems relatively stable with minor fluctuations as age increases from 16 to around 76.
There is a noticeable peak for both genders in the age group of late 40s to early 50s, indicating longer trip durations for users in this age range.he trend lines for known genders (male and female) are more consistent compared to the unknown gender, implying more reliable data or larger sample sizes.

The data suggests that stations along major streets like Broadway and 6th Avenue are particularly popular. Expanding or placing new stations along these routes could improve service efficiency,he station with the highest count of trips ending there is "Pershing Square North" with 3,835 trips.The second most popular end station is "E 17 St & Broadway" with 3,332 trips.

this analysis of the top 50 bike end stations in 2019 indicates a strong preference for central Manhattan locations, with particularly high usage around Midtown and major business and tourist areas. This data can guide operational improvements, maintenance prioritization, and strategic expansion of the Citibike network to meet user demands effectively.There is a notable cluster of end stations around key business and tourist areas such as Midtown Manhattan, with multiple high-frequency end stations located near Broadway and 6th Avenue.
